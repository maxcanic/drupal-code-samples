"To log in using OpenID, a user must already have an OpenID account. "
"Users can then create site accounts using their OpenID, assign one or "
"more OpenIDs to an existing account, and log in using an OpenID. This "
"lowers the barrier to registration, which helps increase the user "
"base, and offers convenience and security to the users. Because OpenID "
"cannot guarantee a user is legitimate, email verification is still "
"necessary. When logging in, users are presented with the option of "
"entering their OpenID URL, which will look like "
"<em>myusername.openidprovider.com</em>. The site then communicates "
"with the OpenID server, asking it to verify the identity of the user. "
"If the user is logged into their OpenID server, the server "
"communicates back to your site, verifying the user. If they are not "
"logged in, the OpenID server will ask the user for their password. At "

"There are two main reasons for reusing fields. First, reusing fields "

msgstr ""
"Er zijn twee goede redenen om velden te hergebruiken. Ten eerste is "
